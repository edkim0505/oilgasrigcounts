# oilgasrigcounts

This is an RShiny project on US land oil and gas rig counts which allows for:
 - easy/dynamic visualization of a time series of oil or gas rig counts since 2011 and by basin.
 - correlation of oil and gas rig counts to oil and gas prices respectively.
 - scatterplot and regression of rig counts in each basin vs. oil/gas prices.
